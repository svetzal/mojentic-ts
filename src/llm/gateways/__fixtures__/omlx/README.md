# oMLX fixtures

Raw responses from a live oMLX server, used by `../../omlx.test.ts`.

## Provenance

These files are byte-identical copies of `fixtures/omlx/` in the mojentic
monorepo (`svetzal/mojentic-unify`), copied on 2026-09-29. The port's CI
cannot see the monorepo, so the copies live here. The contract they support is
`OMLX-2026-09.md` at the monorepo root.

They were captured on 2026-09-29 from oMLX 0.7.0rc1 (Homebrew, macOS, Apple
Silicon) serving `Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-8bit`. The files are unedited. Response
headers are not included.

Do not edit these files. When the monorepo fixtures change, copy them again.

| File | Request |
| ---- | ------- |
| `chat_thinking.json` | Plain chat, model default (thinking on) |
| `chat_thinking_disabled.json` | Same, with `enable_thinking: false` |
| `chat_tool_call.json` | One tool offered; the model calls it |
| `chat_after_tool_result.json` | The tool result sent back as a `tool` message |
| `chat_json_schema.json` | `response_format` `json_schema`, grammar enforced |
| `chat_length.json` | `max_tokens: 5`; truncated during thinking |
| `stream_thinking.sse` | Streamed plain chat, `include_usage` |
| `stream_tool_call.sse` | Streamed tool call |
| `stream_length.sse` | Streamed, `max_tokens: 5` |
| `models.json` | `GET /v1/models` |
| `model_load.json`, `model_unload.json` | Load and unload |
| `error_model_not_loaded.json` | Unload of a model that is not loaded (400) |
| `error_model_not_found.json` | Chat with an unknown model (404) |

Every stream starts with a keep-alive frame whose `model` is `keepalive`.
