# Tutorial: Building Autonomous Agents

## What is an Autonomous Agent?

An autonomous agent is a system that can perceive its environment, reason about how to achieve a goal, and take actions (use tools) to accomplish that goal. Unlike a simple chatbot, an agent has a loop of "Thought -> Action -> Observation".

## The Simple Recursive Agent (SRA)

Mojentic provides a `SimpleRecursiveAgent` pattern. This agent:
1.  Receives a goal.
2.  Thinks about the next step.
3.  Selects a tool to use.
4.  Executes the tool.
5.  Observes the result.
6.  Repeats until the goal is met.

## Building an Agent

Let's build an agent that can answer questions using a web search tool.

### 1. Setup

You'll need the `WebSearchTool` (or any other tool) and a Broker.

```typescript
import { LlmBroker, OllamaGateway, WebSearchTool, SimpleRecursiveAgent } from 'mojentic';

// Initialize broker
const gateway = new OllamaGateway();
const broker = new LlmBroker('qwen3:32b', gateway);

// Configure tools
const tools = [new WebSearchTool({ provider: 'tavily' })];
```

### 2. Run the Agent

```typescript
const goal = "Find out who won the latest Super Bowl and tell me the score.";

const result = await SimpleRecursiveAgent.run(broker, goal, tools);

console.log(`Final Answer: ${result}`);
```

## Step-by-Step Execution

When you run this, the agent enters a loop:

1.  **Thought**: "I need to search for the latest Super Bowl winner."
2.  **Action**: Calls `WebSearchTool` with query "latest Super Bowl winner score".
3.  **Observation**: Receives search results (e.g., "Kansas City Chiefs defeated San Francisco 49ers 25-22...").
4.  **Thought**: "I have the information. I can now answer the user."
5.  **Final Answer**: "The Kansas City Chiefs won the latest Super Bowl with a score of 25-22."

## Customizing the Agent

You can customize the agent's behavior by:
-   **Adding more tools**: Give it file access, calculation abilities, etc.
-   **System Prompt**: Adjust its personality or constraints.
-   **Max Iterations**: Limit how many steps it can take to prevent infinite loops.

```typescript
await SimpleRecursiveAgent.run(broker, goal, tools, {
  maxIterations: 10
});
```

## Summary

Autonomous agents allow you to solve complex, multi-step problems. By combining a reasoning loop with a set of tools, you can build systems that can interact with the world to achieve user goals.
